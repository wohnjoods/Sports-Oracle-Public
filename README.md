# Sports Oracle

## What is it?
It is a website: www.sportsoracle.net that gives daily predictions of college basketball games using a proprietary trained deep learning neural net.

## Background
It all started from the simple question, "can we predict a perfect March Madness bracket?". I created a model to compete in Google's CBB machine learning competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2019, placed in the top 1% 3 years running, and decided to make a website around it.
